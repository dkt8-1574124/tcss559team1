1.Import the project in  Enterprise Eclipse
2.Setup the Google App Engine (Standard)
3.Run the Google Engine Server.
4.Access the website through: http://localhost:8080/

(Note: Since I turn off the SQL instance, all of the pages might now be responsive because

Contact dkt8@uw.edu (Duy) or luongbb@uw.edu (Brad) if you want us to turn on the server for better experience.)
